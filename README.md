## Exercism

[Exercism](https://exercism.io/) is an open source platform that promotes learning new programming languages. 

I found this site when I was looking out for programming examples for Rust, that I'm currently learning.

I use this to keep up to date with languages that I'm not currently working with, as reinforcement learning.

My current tracks are:
* Rust
* Python
* Javascript (node.js)
* Go
* C
* Bash
